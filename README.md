Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) commonly works in sparse view due to data acquisition limitations. However, reconstruction suffers from serious deterioration (e.g., severe artifacts) using traditional algorithms under sparse view. Here, a novel accelerated model-based 
iterative reconstruction strategy for sparse-view PAT aided by multi-channel autoencoder priors was proposed. A multi-channel denoising autoencoder network was designed to learn prior information, which provides constraints for model-based iterative reconstruction. This 
integration accelerates the iteration process, leading to optimal reconstruction outcomes. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using blood vessels simulation data and experimental data. The results show that the proposed method can achieve superior sparse-view reconstruction with a significant acceleration of iteration. Notably, the proposed method exhibits excellent performance under extremely sparse condition (e.g., 32 projections) compared with the U-Net method, with an improvement of 48% in PSNR and 12% in SSIM 
for in vivo experimental data.
